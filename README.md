# PredictingCollegeAdmission

## About
As someone who is aiming to pursue masters , I was always curious whether ill get admit in my dream  college, this project based on Regression, will help students know the probability that they can get into a  college based on the inputs (GRE, TOEFL, University Rating, SOP, LOR, CGPA, Research).

## Aim 
To train a model that can put out the probability of getting an admission in a college.

## How
There are thousands of universities all across the globe and its a very hard task to individually evaluate each universities admission chances.
To overcome this problem , we created a feautre "University Rating" that tells us how highly a uni is rated and how hard is it to get in, University with high rating requires high GRE, TOEFL, SOP, LOR, CGPA, Research points. A simple linear regression model is trained.

## Notebook
The .ipynb file contains all the code from importing the required libraries -> Importing Data -> Data Preprocessing -> Training the Model.

## Dataset
The Dataset contains features like GRE, TOEFL, University Rating, SOP, LOR, CGPA, Research , which are the key factors for getting an admission in to a college.
